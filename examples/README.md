# Examples

This folder contains two examples of Geppetto's resume, tailored for two different jobs. These examples are not meant to be polished, but to simply illustrate the possibilities. Both are created using the `resume generate` and `resume render` commands, based on Geppetto's master resume in `root/yaml_resume_cli/resume.yaml` and templates found in `root/yaml_resume_cli/templates`.
